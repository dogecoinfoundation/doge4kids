	  <h1>Doge 4 Kids</h1>

	  <p>The Dogecoin Foundation are partnering with the amazing folks at charity 4 Paws for Ability and crowfunding platform Crowdtilt to help provide service dogs to children in need.</p>

	  <p>As part of our “Doge 4 Kids” campaign, we're hoping to raise 20 million DOGE, the equivalent of US$30,000 by the end of February, 2014.</p>

	  <p style="display:none" class="suchcurrency"><span></span> of 20,000,000 DOGE target donated so far!</p>

	  <p>4 Paws for Ability is a comprehensive service doge organization that strives to take the “dis” out of disability by providing highly-trained service dogs to children, regardless of age, disability, or geographic location.</p>

	<p>Since its inception in 1998, 4 Paws has placed over 650 dogs across the United States and in  countries including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Japan and Switzerland.</p>

	<p>The US$30,000 raised will help sponsor:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Two litters of puppies who’ll be trained and paired with children as they grow up</li>
	<li>Two adult service dogs being placed with families in need</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once the campaign is funded, our friends at 4 Paws will post regular updates including photos of the sponsored puppies and service dogs, so we can track their progress.</p>

	<p>We’ve worked closely with Crowdtilt in the past, who are helping the foundation run the campaign and process both DOGE and USD donations.</p>
